/// Consensus Pricing Mechanism
/// The process of promoting data from the submit ledger to the permanent ledger involves multiple phases, resulting in a staged payment model for permanent data. All transactions, whether intended for permanent (perm) or temporary (term) data, initially enter the submit ledger. The payment process for term data is consistent across all transactions, while permanent data incurs additional payments to incentivize the complete publishing process.
///
/// ## Term Data Payment Distribution
/// 1. User posts a transaction including the term_fee.
/// 2. Block producer transaction inclusion:
///   - Block producer includes the transaction in a block.
///   - Block producer's balance increases by 5% of the term_fee.
///   - Remaining 95% of term_fee is added to the treasury (tracked in block headers).
/// 3. The user uploads data chunks associated with their transaction.
/// 4. Miners assigned to store chunks gossip them amongst themselves.
/// 5. Term ledger expiration payout:
///   - When the transaction expires from the submit ledger (when the partitions containing its chunks are reset at an epoch boundary), each miner is paid their portion (term_fee / num_chunks_in_partition) for all assigned chunks expiring in their partition.
///   - For a full 16TB partition, this payout is approximately $0.60 per miner.
///   - Miners continue to earn full inflation/block rewards from any blocks they produce while mining these partitions.
///
/// ## Permanent Data Payment Distribution
/// Users pay the following fees for permanent data storage:
/// - term_fee: Standard fee for term storage (distributed as with regular term data)
/// - perm_fee: Total fee for permanent storage which includes:
///   - Base permanent storage cost (200 years × 10 replicas with 1% annual decline)
///   - PLUS ingress proof rewards (5% of term_fee × number_of_ingress_proofs)
///
/// ### Fee Distribution
/// - term_fee: Processed identically to regular term data transactions.
/// - 5% of term_fee for each ingress-proof provided. These rewards are included in the transaction's `perm_fee` field along with the base permanent storage cost.
/// - perm_fee total value: Prepaid amount covering 200 years x 10 replicas with 1% annual decline in storage costs PLUS ingress proof rewards (5% of term_fee × number_of_ingress_proofs)
