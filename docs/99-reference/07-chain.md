# General chain configuration notes

## EVM - Gas Limit
The default/target gas limit is configured as 30 million gas per block on testnet & mainnet. As the network matures, we plan to increase this target up to 60+ million gas per block. There is currently no per-transaction gas limit, the only effective gas limit is that enforced by the block.
