# General chain configuration notes

## EVM - Gas Limit
The default/target gas limit is configured as 30M/block on testnet & mainnet. As the network matures, we will probably increase this target up to 60+M. There is currently no per-transaction gas limit, the only effective gas limit is that enforced by the block.
